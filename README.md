### Course Management System

**Introduction**  
The Course Management System (CMS) is a web-based platform designed to provide a seamless experience for learners and instructors in managing online courses. Inspired by platforms like Udemy, the system allows users to browse, enroll, and manage courses, while instructors can create, publish, and monetize their content. With robust features, modern technologies, and a user-centric interface, the CMS ensures an efficient, scalable, and interactive learning ecosystem.
