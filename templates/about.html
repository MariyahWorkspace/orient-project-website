                <p> Orient<span id="copyright">&copy;</span> is a simplified approach towards courses, lectures, or events and their management that allows the organizations to schedule their programs, and the users to apply for it. A systematic approach that can be used by educaters and students to manage their courses and events. This system can be implemented and integrated individually at organizational level, or as a whole system that can be used by the whole organization. </p>
                <p>We, the 'No Brain Cells' (DevTeam) is undoubtedly a keen group that's primarily interested in trying out new things. Henceforth, we are trying to step up towards benevolent causes that could change the world for the better, just like Batman is good for the world. We believe in delivering a 'change.' As someone great used to say, "If you want to make enemies, try to change something," and oh do we love making enemies. Diabolical, innit?</p>
